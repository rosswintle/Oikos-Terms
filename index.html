These terms and conditions make those expectations clear and are intended to protect you and us from anything unexpected happening.</p>
						<p>For the purposes of these terms and conditions, "we", "us" and "our" refers to Oikos Digital Ltd., and "you" and "your" refers to you or the organisation that you represent.

								<li>2.1. We re-sell hosting services from larger hosting companies. To host your website through us you will need to accept the terms and conditions, terms of use, privacy policy and any other legal documents from the re-sold hosting provider. These documents, or links to them, will be given to you for acceptance before the hosting service commences.</li>
								<li>2.2. We shall endeavor to keep your site running for the duration of the hosting agreement.  However, the availability of your site cannot be guaranteed as we are subject to the availability of the service provided by the hosting companies that we re-sell from, and we can accept no liability for losses incurred as a result of your website failing.</li>
								<li>2.3. You are responsible for making sure that your software, code and data is backed up.  We endeavour to provide our own backups where possible, but this is not a guaranteed part of our hosting service.

								<li>2.4. You must not use the hosting that Oikos Digital provides for anything illegal or offensive. Examples are usually given in the reseller hosting company's terms of use.  If this happens we, or our hosting supplier will suspend your account.  Neither Oikos Digital nor the hosting supplier will be responsible for any loss of customer data should this occur.</li>
								<li>2.5. Any data that an you store on the hosting service we provide will remain your property and we can provide a download of it on request.  Depending on the nature of the download request this may incur a small cost.</li>
								<li>2.6. The GDPR requires that you, as data controller for your website, enter into a data processing agreement with us. Acceptance of these terms therefore also includes acceptance of the Data Processing Agreement at <a href="https://rosswintle.github.io/Oikos-Terms/processor-agreement.html">https://rosswintle.github.io/Oikos-Terms/processor-agreement.html</a>

								<li>3.2. Domain names shall be registered in your name or in the name of your organisation.</li>
								<li>3.3. We re-sell domains from larger registrar companies.

								<li>3.4. Domain names are purchased for a fixed period of one or more years.  At the end of this period we shall notify you that the renewal is due.

							<p>This section applies to all Oikos Digital customers.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>5.1. We normally build customer websites using software that is released under open -source licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the MIT license.  In some cases other licenses will apply.</li>
								<li>5.2. Anything that we creates that is a derivative work of something released under the GPL, is also subject to the GPL.  This means that:

											<li>you will maintain copyright of it;</li>
											<li>you are not required to release it to the public, but if you do then you must give other people permission to copy, distribute and modify it under the terms of the GPL.</li>
										</ul>
										If a license other than the GPL applies then the you are bound by the terms of that license.
								<li>5.3. Any work that you create using services provided by us will be the copyright of the customer.</li>
								<li>5.4. Any work that we create for you, will be owned by you.  You grants Oikos Digital Ltd. an unlimited license to use, copy, and modify the works and to base other works upon them.  This is to allow us to re-use the work that we do rather than create everything from scratch.</li>
								<li>5.5. Content uploaded by you to a website hosted by or through us must be either:
									<ul>
										<li>owned by you, or your own copyright;</li>
										<li>licensed to you for your usage on the website;</li>

									</ul>

						<h2>6. Data Processing Agreement</h2>
						<div class="terms-section">
							<p>This section applies to all Oikos Digital customers.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>6.1. Many projects will involve us processing personal data that you are data controller for.

							</li>

						<h2>7. Projects, Proposals and Payments</h2>
						<div class="terms-section">
							<p>This section applies to all Oikos Digital customers.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>6.1. At the start of a project, we will produce a project proposal for you, detailing your needs, and what work will be done, and when.</li>
								<li>6.2. When the details of the work to be done have been agreed, we will provide you with an estimate or quote detailing charges for doing the work.  The estimate or quote will state whether the work will be done for a fixed price, or at an hourly rate.</li>
								<li>6.3. Sometimes things will go wrong, or details of a project will change.  If this happens we will keep you informed of what's happening, why it's happening, and agree any changes to the proposal and costs with you.</li>
								<li>6.4. Most projects will be a collaborative effort and will involve contribution from you and your organisation in order for timescales to be met.  We will keep you informed of what we need from you and when, but if the things we need are not provided in time then the project may be delayed. We will agree with you any resulting changes to the proposal and deadline.</li>
								<li>6.5. For fixed-price projects an invoice will be submitted once the work detailed in the proposal is complete, or according to an agreed payment schedule.</li>
								<li>6.6. For hourly-rate projects we will submit invoices at durations agreed as part of the project proposal or in other communcation with you as the project progresses.</li>
								<li>6.7. Payment is due by cheque or electronic bank transfer 30 days from the date of the invoice.  Specific payment details are stated on our invoices. We reserve the right to charge interest and claim compensation for debt recovery costs on late or unpaid invoices.</li>

						<h2>8. Technical support and operation</h2>
						<div class="terms-section">
							<p>This section applies to all Oikos Digital customers.</p>
							<ol>

								<li>7.2. We endeavour to produce web sites and pages that display in most popular modern browsers, but we cannot be responsible for pages not displaying in older or un-supported broswers.

						</div>
						
						<h2>9. Portfolio Usage</h2>
						<div class="terms-section">
							<p>This section applies to all Oikos Digital customers.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>8.1. We like to talk about the work that we have done in order to drum up new business.  You therefore agree that we can display and link to the completed work as part of our website portfolio, and that we can talk about and write about the project on websites, in future proposals, and in the media. We will not use specific client quotes of feedback without permission. If, for some reason, you do not want us to mention you as a client, or your project, then please let us know - we do make exceptions.</li>
								<li>8.2. You also agree that we can, as part of the design and work, include a link back to the Oikos Digital website - this will be discrete and usually in the footer of your site. Again, if for some reason you do not want this then let us know.</li>

							<p>This section applies to all Oikos Digital customers.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>10.1. We will give you advice and suggest software tools, third-party services, and processes for using them.  We are confident that we know lots of useful things and our aim is to share them with you in order to make your life and work easier.</li>
								<li>10.2. However, the internet and technology change quickly and, while we do our best to stay up to date, we do not guarantee that what we knows is the latest or best information.  We can not therefore accept liability for any costs incurred by you that are caused by us providing you with information or advice that is viewed by anyone as being inaccurate, out of date, or not current best practice.</li>
