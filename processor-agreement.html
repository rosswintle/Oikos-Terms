							<p>
								All definitions used in this clause shall have the definition set out in the Data 
								Protection Legislation. 
							</p>
							<p>
								In this document, “you” and “your” refers to either yourself if you are the controller, 
								or the organisation you represent if it is the data controller.
							</p>
							<p>
								Oikos Digital Ltd and you acknowledge that you are the controller and Oikos Digital Ltd 
								is the processor and that you retain control of the Personal Data and remain responsible 
								for its compliance obligations under Data Protection Legislation. Oikos Digital Ltd may 
								process the Personal Data categories and Data Subject types set out in Schedule 1 of this 
								Agreement. Each party agrees to comply with all applicable requirements of the Data 
								Protection Legislation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Processor shall:
								<ul>
									<li>
										implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that 
										processing will meet the requirements of Data Protection Legislation and ensure 
										the protection of the rights of the Data Subject;
									</li>
									<li>
										only authorise a third party (“sub-processor”) to process the Personal Data if (i) the the sub-processor fits into one of the categories set out in Schedule 1 and (ii) the Processor has ensured that the sub-processor has a similar degree of security of data to the Processor as described in the Processor’s privacy policy and (iii) the Processor maintains control over all Personal Data it shares with the sub-processor and (iv) the Processor ensures that the sub-processor does not process the Personal Data except on instructions from the Data Controller (unless required to do so by Union or Member State law);
									</li>
									<li>
										where the controller has provided prior general written authorisation for the 
										appointment of sub-processors, the processor shall inform the controller of any 
										intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of sub-processors, 
										thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes. If the 
										controller so objects, the processor shall immediately terminate the appointment 
										of such sub-processors. If the processor fails to terminate the appointment of 
										such sub-processors, the controller may terminate the services agreement with 
										immediate effect without any liability.
									</li>
									<li>
										process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Controller, 
										unless required to do so by Data Protection Legislation to which the Processor is 
										subject; in such a case, the Processor shall inform the Controller of that legal 
										requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on 
										important grounds of public interest;
									</li>
									<li>
										ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data (such as its 
										employees) have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an 
										appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;
									</li>
									<li>
										ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures, 
										reviewed and approved by the Controller, to ensure a level of security 
										appropriate to the risk (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of 
										implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well 
										as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of 
										Natural Persons) including, where appropriate, the pseudonymisation and 
										encryption of Personal Data, the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, 
										integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services, the 
										ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely 
										manner in the event of a physical or technical incident and a process for 
										regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical 
										and organisational measures for ensuring the security of processing. Account 
										shall also be taken of the risks that are presented by the processing in 
										particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, 
										unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or 
										otherwise processed;
									</li>
									<li>
										taking into account the nature of the processing, assist the Controller by 
										appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, 
										for the fulfilment of the Controller’s obligation to respond to requests for 
										exercising the Data Subject’s rights set out in Chapter III of the GDPR;
									</li>
									<li>
										assist the Controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations set out in 
										Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR (data breach) taking into account the nature of 
										processing and the information available to the Processor;
									</li>
									<li>
										at the choice of the Controller, delete or return all the Personal Data to the 
										Controller after the termination or expiry of this Agreement and delete existing 
										copies (unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data);
									</li>
									<li>
										make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate 
										compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR and allow for 
										and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or 
										another auditor mandated by the Controller; 
									</li>
									<li>
										assist the Controller in ensuring compliance with the requirement to carry out 
										Data Protection Impact Assessments as set out in Article 35 of GDPR, taking into 
										account the nature of processing and the information available to the Processor; 
									</li>
									<li>
										immediately inform the Controller, if in the opinion of the Processor, an 
										instruction from the Controller infringes Data Protection Legislation; 
									</li>
									<li>
										promptly comply with any request by or instruction from the Controller to process 
										the Personal Data, or to stop, mitigate or remedy any unauthorised processing; 
									</li>
									<li>
										keep all Personal Data confidential and not disclose such data to third parties 
										unless specifically authorised in writing by the Controller or as required by 
										law.   If the Processor is required by law, court, regulator or supervisory 
										authority to process or disclose any Personal Data, the Processor will first 
										inform the Controller of this and allow the Controller to object or challenge the 
										requirement, unless the law prohibits the Processor from informing the 
										Controller; 
									</li>
									<li>
										not transfer or otherwise process Personal Data outside the European Economic 
										Area (EEA) without obtaining the Controller’s prior written consent (except where 
										the Processor is required to transfer such data by Union or Member State law, in 
										which case the Processor shall inform the Controller of such legal requirement 
										before processing takes place, unless any law prohibits such disclosure on 
										important grounds of public interest) and (i) there is an appropriate safeguard 
										or derogation for such transfer in accordance with part V of the GDPR;

							<p>
								<strong>For website hosting</strong>, the Processor will keep data for the duration of

								may exist and these may take a short time (normally a month) to expire and be erased.

								<strong>For other data</strong>: the Processor will try to minimise all other processing 
								of the Personal Data, but sometimes work requests involve specific individuals. In
