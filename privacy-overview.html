						This is a summary of the full Oikos Privacy Policy that helps you see at a glance what information we collect and store.

							<h2>
								For everyone!
							</h2>
						</a>

						<div class="section-content">
							<p>
								We do everything we can to minimise the data we collect and store, and to keep it secure. We use strong, random, unique passwords on all online services stored in secure systems and we use two-factor authentication where available. We encrypt data where possible and we look after our mobile devices.
							</p>

							<p>
								We try to use UK/EU based services, but many cloud-based online systems are US-based. Whenever your data is sent outside the EU we ensure that appropriate protections are in place, such as the EU-US Privacy Shield.

									We will store your contact details so we can contact you about your enquiry. This information will be synced through cloud services to mobile devices too.
								</li>
								<li>
									We may make our own notes about your enquiry and the people involved in note-taking software synced using cloud computing services.
								</li>
								<li>
									We may put details of the enquiry and the people involved in a to-do list, CRM system or project management software to ensure the enquiry is dealt with by the right person and at the right time - this will also be synced using cloud-based services.
								</li>
								<li>
									We know we're a technology company, but we will sometimes make notes about projects and people on paper or other physical media too. These are not synced using cloud computing, but we keep them safe.

								<li>
									Website enquiries will be emailed to us and processed as above, and also stored on the website.

							<p>
								We will store and process data needed to provide your hosting service.

							<p>
								Because hosting can involve providing support of the hosting service and communications about the hosting service, all of the guidelines in "If we work on a project with/for you" may apply. In addition:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
									We will add details of you and your services to our online hosting management, support and billing software tool, which you will have client access to.
								</li>
								<li>
									We will add you to our hosting mailing list to provide you with service updates by email.
								</li>
								<li>
									We will act as a data processor for all personal information stored in your website's database and files.
								</li>
								<li>
									Because we re-sell hosting from a hosting provider, the hosting provider will be a sub-processor of all personal information stored in your website's database and files.
								</li>
								<li>
									If you provide us with any login details for any support or maintenance activity, we will request that these be securely transmitted, and we will store them securely in a password vault until they are no longer needed.
								</li>
								<li>
									Your contact details will be stored and processed in a hosting account on the web server
								</li>
								<li>
									If we are setting up a content management system or web application (such as WordPress) for you then your contact details will be stored and processed in that CMS/application too.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								We also back up websites, so there will be copies of any personal information stored in your website's database and files stored on the appropriate backup services. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Please note that if you collect or store or process personal information on or through your website, you are also a data controller and will need to understand your responsibilities.
